                    Hey there, I&apos;m Facundo Valerio - founder of Codedicated.
                    Through the last years I&apos;ve been improving my software development skills to bring you curated
                    content, products and services.

                    2023â€“2024 was one of the most changing periods of my life thus far. <br/>
                    Y began to consolidate the idea of what would end up being called Codedicated.
                </Paragraph>

                <Paragraph className=" mt-4">
                    I understood that as one-person team, I had to optimize my development experience to the maximum by
                    focusing on the user experience of my products. <br/>
                    That&apos;s when I met Supabase, and I could forget about writing and maintaining backend
                    code. <br/>
                    It was at that moment that I started to see the idea of Codedicated beyond my wildest dreams
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph className=" mt-4">
                    In parallel, I was realizing that we had waited long enough for the biggest dream with my
                    wife. <br/>
                    I decided to bring it up to her, and as of this writing, on July 24, we are about to welcome
                    Vittorio. Our first child.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph className=" mt-4">
                    If you came this far, I want to thank you for being here. I <br/>
                    hope you enjoy the content that I create and that it brings you value. <br/>
